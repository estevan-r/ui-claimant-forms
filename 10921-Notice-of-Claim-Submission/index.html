                  Detecting and preventing unemployment insurance fraud is a
                  priority for our agency. You must tell the truth and
                  understand that not doing so is fraud and you could be fined
                  or go to jail. Claims are audited regularly to ensure benefits
                  are paid according to state and federal law.

                <p>
                  After you complete your initial claim filing, you can start
                  requesting payment and certifying your eligibility weekly. You
                  need to do this every week, including while you wait for a
                  decision on your claim and during the waiting week. If you
                  fail to request payment/certify for a week, your claim will
                  become inactive.

            <p>
              According to Colorado law, we must look at the details of your
              claim to ensure you are eligible for benefits. The amount of time
              it takes to process claims varies and may take up to 4 to 5 weeks
              from the file date.

                  unemployment, and identity verification, among others.
